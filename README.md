# web-scraping
web scraping in code php.

In this project I have scrapped two pages from bseindia.com and nseindia.com

If you want to scrap other url then you need to follow this steps:

i)go to bse_nse.php file

ii)change urls of bse and nse

iii)update the required data like number of columns in header and number of columns in body of bse/nse table

iv)you can change design from stock_data.php file

v)custom.js file in js folder updates all data every 5 seconds and populates stock_data.php file.
